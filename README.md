Class That Show  the structure  of my code  with component Interaction .
Using design  pattern like Factory  ,  Strategy ,  MVC , Observer ,  Mediator  , Template Method , Singleton(not showing in the class) , Builder (not showing in the class) .
Using Event Bus  .
The most Powerful structure is Using Generic + Template Method Design Pattern => This  allow me to get a solid implementation  in the abstraction level .
In My Project i focus all the time  in the  separation  of concern  and in separate the  changeable  part of my code in another classes so this also mayk my code maintainable , extensible  .
If I have a separate  Logic of Classess that  need the same implementation (In this case i use  dependency  and avoiding to use  polymorphism ) .

Thank You For Reading ;)
